# Leaflet Routing Machine - Esri plugin

> enables walk, drive and truck routing using Esri's hosted service.

### Demo
Check out the live [demo](http://jgravois.github.io/lrm-esri/examples/index.html).

### Usage

![animation](animation.gif)

```html
<script src="./lrm-esri.js"></script>
```

```js
/*
additional profiles:
Walking, Trucking, Rural Driving, Walking Distance, Trucking Distance, Driving Distance and Rural Driving Distance
*/
var control = L.Routing.control({
	router: L.Routing.esri({
    liveTraffic: true,
    profile: 'Driving'
  })
}).addTo(map);
```
### Features

Esri's hosted routing service can find the shortest driving, truck and walk time *or* distance for up to 150 input stops. It is able to incorporate both live and historic traffic and can reorder input stops to find the optimal sequence.

## Authentication

### Use a proxied service

You can allow anonymous users to get directions in your application by leveraging a proxied service - [live demo](http://jgravois.github.io/lrm-esri/examples/index.html)

1. Sign up for a [free developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/)
2. Create your own [proxied service url](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/working-with-proxies/#arcgis-online-hosted-proxy)
3. supply the `url` in the provider constructor

```js
var control = L.Routing.control({
  router: L.Routing.esri({
    url: '<your proxied service url>'
  })
}).addTo(map);
```

When credentials are embedded, 1250 requests/month are provided for free. [Deployment packs](https://developers.arcgis.com/credits/) are available to help you scale.

### Use OAuth2

You can also use [OAuth2](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/) and bill routing charges directly to existing ArcGIS users - [live demo](https://johngravois.com/lrm-esri/examples/oauth/index.html)

1. Sign up for a [free developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/)
2. Create and register a new application
3. Reference your `clientID` in your app and configure a `redirectUri`
4. after the user signs in, supply their `token` in the provider constructor (more info [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/browser-based-user-logins/))

```js
var control = L.Routing.control({
  router: L.Routing.esri({
    token: '<user token>'
  })
}).addTo(map);
```

### Development Instructions
